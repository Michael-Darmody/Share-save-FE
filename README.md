# Share-save-FE


## Introduction
ShareSave is a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that can be used to manage and track shares purchased. This was my first project at QA academy and incorperates full stack development, HTML, CSS & Javascript were used in the front-end, the back-end was comprised of Spring and H2/MySQL were used to manage Database interactions.

## Project Brief
The overall objective for this project was the following:

- To create a CRUD application with the utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate  all core modules covered during training.

### Scope
- A Jira board with full expansion on user stories, use cases and tasks needed to complete the project. This can be found here
- Clear Documentation from a design phase describing the architecture you will use for your project.
- A relational database used to store data persistently for the project.
- A functional application created in the OOP language, following best practices and design principles, that you have covered during training, this application needs to meet the requirements set on your Kanban Board.
- The application must have a functioning front-end website and integrated API.
- Fully designed test suites for the application you are creating, as well as automated tests for validation of the application.
- You must meet an acceptable level of test coverage in your backend and provide consistent reports and evidence that you have done so.
- Code fully integrated into a Version Control System

### Constraints
The application needed to utilise the technologies discussed during our training. The tech stack that was required was the following:

- Kanban Board: Jira
- Database: SQL Server
- Programming language: Java (unless stated otherwise)
- Front-end: HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Unit Tests: JUnit and Mockito
- Integration Tests: MockMVC and Selenium
- Version Control: Git

## My Approach
I chose to create a Share manager application to meet this project breif. I chose to go down this route due to my interest in the stock market as well as the fact its relatively simple to implement but open to lots of improvement as an application. **ShareSave** allows the user to do the following: * Create shares in the database * Read the shares from the database, including newly created ones * Sort the data from the database(and read it) * Update existing shares in the database * Delete any shares s from the database.

## Jira Board
As specified in the project brief I used Jira as a project management software. For my implementation I modelled it as an agile scrum board. This was used to manage my workflow throughout the project and allowed me to implement agile methodologies, workflow normally followed this pattern:

1. Creating User stories, tasks and relevant subtasks to be completed then assigning relevant priorities and points based on what needed to be done.

2. Moving those into the sprint backlog from the product backlog

3. As tasks were undertaken and completed they were moved along the kanban board allowing for a good visual representation of the status of the project.
